# AESOP README
Aesop is a project currently under development.

## Features
<!-- Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file. -->

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

Aesop uses Fable, a simple, React-like helper library, to generate its main and add-ons UI. You should not need to install React if you are not building your app with React.

Though Aesop's declaration files are written in TypeScript, you should not need any additional transpilers than those included with your installation of VSCode.

Aesop depends on:
  - babel
  - tsc-loader
  - express

<!-- 
If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them. -->

## Extension Settings
Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

This extension contributes the following settings:
* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Release Notes
Aesop is a project currently under development by Async. Please check back in late January for the 1.0 launch.

### 0.0.1

Begun development stage.
